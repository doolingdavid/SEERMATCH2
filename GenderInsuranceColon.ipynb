    "This ipython notebook will illustrate the matching methodology we will use to match patients in the SEER-Medicare linked database. The comparison between patient outcomes between those patients who receive proton beam therapy vs traditional radiation therapy requires as a first step a matching of the two different groups. One method to perform this matching is to use Propensity Score Matching. Here we are going to illustrate a more direct method of matching using KDTrees, a data structure that allows for efficient finding of nearest neighbors in high-dimenional space.\n"

We will perform the patient matching and show the overall improvement in coviarate balancing that results.
